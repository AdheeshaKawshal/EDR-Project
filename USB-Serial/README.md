# USB-Serial Communication Project

This folder contains resources related to a Microchip Studio project for USB-Serial communication between a PC and an ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The project utilizes the LUFA (Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs) library to implement USB functionality.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to establish a USB-Serial communication link between a PC and the ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The LUFA library is used to handle USB communication, providing a robust and flexible framework for USB device development.

## Requirements

- **Microchip Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
- **LUFA Library**: Download the LUFA library from its [official repository](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa).
- **ATmega32U4 Microcontroller**: This project is specifically designed for the ATmega32U4.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the LUFA library and include it in your project directory.
2. Open the project in Microchip Studio.
3. Ensure all required files from the LUFA library are included in the project. Missing files may cause issues during compilation and linking.
4. Configure the project settings to include the LUFA library paths in the compiler and linker options.

## Building the Project

1. Verify that all LUFA library files are correctly included in the project.
2. Build the project in Microchip Studio.
3. Flash the compiled firmware to the ATmega32U4 microcontroller.

## Notes

- Ensure the LUFA library version is compatible with your Microchip Studio version.
- Refer to the LUFA documentation for additional configuration and usage details.
